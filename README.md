# FLEX
Code for FLEX paper

This code is for the FLEX model.

"Main_vectorized_simple_dopa.m" includes the main code for the simulations - a running the program will run a demo simulation and plot relevant figures afterwards. Comments are included in the file for further instruction.

"spiking_parameters_simple_dopa.m" includes the parameters for use in the main file.

This code was written and run in MATLAB 2021a. Please direct any questions to ianconehed(at)gmail(dot)com. It was tested both on Mac and Windows platforms. It should take no more than 30 minutes to run the code.

The code is described both in the results and the methods section, including equations used.

The figures the code generates are:
